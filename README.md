# Explanation:
- The HTML structure defines a page with a title ("Rothko Painting") and includes an external CSS stylesheet (style.css). The body of the page contains a div with the class frame, which encloses another div with the class canvas. Within the .canvas div, there are three child div elements with classes .one, .two, and .three.
- In the CSS, .canvas sets the dimensions (width and height) of the canvas, sets its background color to a dark brown, applies an overflow of hidden to hide any content that exceeds the dimensions, and applies a blur filter to create a blurred effect.
- .frame styles the outer frame around the canvas. It adds a black border, sets its width, adds padding, and centers the frame using margin.
- .one and .two style the first and second inner divs within the canvas. They set dimensions, background colors, margins, box shadows for a raised effect, border radii for rounded corners, and apply rotation transforms for a subtle tilt effect. Both .one and .two are also blurred slightly using the filter property.
- .three styles the third inner div. It sets dimensions, background color, margin, blur filter, box shadow, border radius, and rotation transform for a distinct look.
